    $template class, "%syslogseverity%,  %syslogfacility%, %timegenerated%,  %HOSTNAME%,  %syslogtag%,  %msg%\n"
# the destination log file us the following 
# all the logs with all facilities and severities levels would be logged on this destination 
#make sure to add the syslog file context on the directory in order to allow rsyslogs to log on the directory (SElinux <3)
    *.* {{your project path}}/test-network/filename.txt;class
    --------------------------------------------------
    2)make sure to reload the rsyslog daemon
